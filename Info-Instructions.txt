> htmVAL Scorebug 1.1 <
Instructions...
1) Create a browser source in OBS.
2) Enable the "Local File" box in the Browser Source's properties.
3) Click "Browse", navigate to the "scorebug.html"
4) Set the width and height of the Browser Source to 2400x1080
5) Make sure the "Custom CSS" section has this inside...

body { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); margin: 0px auto; overflow: hidden; }

6) Press "Okay"
7) Align the top left of the source to the top left corner of the OBS preview
8) Select the new Browser Source and click the "Interact" button on the menu above the "Sources" panel.
	OR
   Right click on the new Browser Source and select "Interact" in the context menu.
9) A new window should show up that displays the browser source.
	> On right side of the interact window, there are Buttons Labeled with their functions.
	> New with the 1.2 update, there is now a FLIP button located under the Reset button.
		>Press the Flip button to switch between the main Scorebug and the Inverted bases.
		> THE SCORES DO NOT FLIP, you will need to adjust that manually using the Team A/B +1 or -1 buttons.

TO EDIT THE OVERLAY IMAGE:
There should be a .PSD in the /img/ folder that you can access and edit/remove team names, add logos, change colors, edit the design, etc.
Make sure to export the edited overlay as .png and save over the existing "VALORANT_Score_Overlay.png" file.
***Do keep in mind that if you do edit the size or position of the "Map Score" boxes, you may need to adjust the position of the <div>s within the styles file.
